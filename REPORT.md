### Bug: Login can land in another merchant
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Type:** Security, critical
- **Problem:** A user whose email exists in two merchants could log in to merchant B with B's password and, after the OTP, end up in merchant A.
- **Cause:** `apps/api/src/routes/auth.ts:64` checks the password for the (merchant, email) pair, but `:78` binds the OTP and session to `findOtpRecipient`, which matches the email across all active merchants with `LIMIT 1` and no `ORDER BY` (`apps/api/src/auth/users.ts:19-20`).
- **Breaks:** Cross-tenant account takeover: anyone who signs up a merchant with a victim's email can be routed into the victim's merchant, or the victim into theirs.
- **Fix:** `findOtpRecipient` now filters on the merchant whose password was just checked; a route test with one email in two merchants fails before and passes after. PR: https://github.com/SilentYsf/fils-pay/pull/5
### Bug: Support admins can post money to merchants as credits
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Type:** Security, high
- **Problem:** A support admin, the read-and-routine-ops role, could post a manual credit of up to 50 BD per call to any merchant, and it went straight to the ledger.
- **Cause:** The create route `apps/api/src/routes/adminCredits.ts:62-77` only had `requireAdminSession`, with no role check, while the approve and reject routes required finance or super_admin. Credits at or under the 50 BD threshold (`apps/api/src/admin/creditThreshold.ts:15`) post to the ledger on create (`apps/api/src/admin/credits.ts:253`). The admin UI hid the form from support, but the API did not.
- **Breaks:** Any support account could move money into a merchant's payable balance, up to 50 BD per call with no limit on calls, bypassing the maker-checker the credits plane is built around.
- **Fix:** Added `requireAdminRole("finance", "super_admin")` to the create route, matching approve and reject. Test added: support posting a credit gets 403 and nothing is journaled. PR: https://github.com/SilentYsf/fils-pay/pull/6
